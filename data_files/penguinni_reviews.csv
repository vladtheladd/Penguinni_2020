0,"[{'body': 'I would like to state that these cups are not made for older kids. The actual stainless cup isnÃ†t made to hold more than 6-8 ounces, so they are best for little ones.\n\nWith that in mind, these are the best sippy cups I have owned for my son. They consist of two (necessary) parts only, the cup and the lid (the gripper band isnÃ†t really required).\n\nYou MUST make sure the lid is dry when you put it on - if it is wet at all it will slip. If you donÃ†t have time to dry it off, skip this cup because you will not have good results (a simple wipe with a paper towel gets it done). The silicone makes an amazing seal on the stainless cup when dry but liquid where is seals causes the lid to not have a solid grip, and then it pops off.\n\nWashing is super simple, I have been handwashing vs dishwasher, but they do say dishwasher safe.\n\nLastly, for a user tip - I like to put the lid on first, and then slide the gripper band over the edge of the lid. Gives me some extra reinforcement there just in case little sneaky toddlers hands decide to yank the top.', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018', 'helpful_vote': '20 people found this helpful', 'rating': '', 'title': 'Make sure the lid is DRY!!', 'verified_buy': 'Verified Purchase'}, {'body': ""This product was difficult to rate. Pros: Came quickly, Packaged well with details on box on how to use, and material seems to be good quality, but difficult to tell durability this soon. Easy to clean and lids appears to stay true to it's word on not leaking! Also if you put a little ice in sippy it will stay cold for hours. Cons: Cups are VERY small! So after sitting the new cup next to another one I've had that was my little ones first training sippy cup there was not much of a difference except the older cup is wider and i'm able to fill to the top( old sippy cup is considered 7 oz munchkin Miracle 360 trainer) , but the new stainless steel sippy cup I can't fill as high due to the risk of spilling when putting lid on so I would consider this cup more of 7 oz or even less and I can't put the lids on my regular cups.( tried 3 different cups and a no go!)The piece that is the same material as lid for little one to hold or grip so fingers don't get hot/cold or to prevent slipping out of hands does not stay on! Ok so somebody please correct me if I'm wrong , but I usually go by oz NOT mL and in the details it states it's 8oz/325mL. See an issue? So I was curious after I saw how small they were and having to fill them twice at every meal wasn't something I had to do before, So I googled 325 mL converted into ounces which equalled well over 8oz cup it was nearly 11oz cup!? So 8oz is not the same as 325 mL and is a conflicting detail( 250mL or some say 240mL is 8oz), Some people may not use oz and only use mL depending on where they live then the cups details on size are 100% not CORRECT! Due to the size I have to fill constantly and if I'm leaving my house more then a few hours I have to pack 2 cups if not 3 if its an all day event! So I will need to get a larger sippy cup for when we're out.My personal opinion is to take my measurements and compare to current cups with measuring tape before ordering. I would not order again especially for the price. I would pay for 2 cups for this price if they were TWICE the size! The cup is 3 3/8 inches tall, top width is exactly 3 inches across, bottom 3 1/8. You will need to give yourself close to half an inch of no fluids at top so you won't spill.
